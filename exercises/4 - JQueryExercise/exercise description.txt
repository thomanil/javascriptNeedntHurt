basic:

Implement the jQueryExercise.changeParagraph() function which is called when the page loads. 
It should find the text paragraph, and change the html content of the paragraph to a different text.

bonus:

In the same function, also use jQuery to add some styling to the paragraph text.
Change the color and font weight of the text. Also make the text change color when 
the mouse cursor hovers over it. The color should also change back to its original hue 
when the mouse cursor leaves the paragraph.
