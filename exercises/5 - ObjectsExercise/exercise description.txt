basic:

Within the ObjectsExercise object literal, declare another object called InnerObject.
InnerObject should have a member variable named 'foo', which should be initialized to 55.
InnerObject should also have a method named 'getFoo()', which returns the value of foo.
Use a unit test to verify that it works.

bonus:

The test method 'testEvalJSONAndCallResultingObject' contains a variable named 'JSONString'.
'JSONString' defines a chunk of JSON data. The JSON data format is the same as the 
JavaScript object literal format, and can be turned into a live JavaScript object on the fly.

There are two syntax errors in the chunk of JSON, which makes it an invalid JavaScript 
object and therefore unparsable. Fix the errors.

When the errors are fixed, implement ObjectsExercise.turnJSONStringIntoObject(JSONString) 
which takes a JSON string, turns it into a live JavaScript object, and returns that object.
This should make the test run. Hint: use jQuery.parseJSON().
