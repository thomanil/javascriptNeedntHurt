basic:

Start Firefox. Open the Firebug tool. Load the index.html page. 
With Firebug, change the style of the page - directly in the DOM inspector, 
without reloading the page or editing the css file.

Do the following things:

- Change background color of document to blue
- Change text color of document to yellow
- Double the font size

bonus:

Use the Firebug interactive console to add a button with some behavior: When the button is clicked, pop up
a dialog ( alert("Button pressed!"); ). Again, both button and its event handler must be added directly
using Firebug. No editing of the js file allowed, no reload of index.html allowed.
