basic:

The FunctionsExercise object has a method called incrementEachElement(). 
It should take an array of numbers and return a new array, where each 
element has been incremented by one. See the testArrayIncrementEveryElementOfArray() 
test for expected behavior. Implement incrementEachElement() using the 
jQuery.map() function (alternatively, write your own map() function).

bonus:

Implement FunctionsExercise.doOnEach(). 
It should take an array and a function as parameters.
For each element in the array, pass that element to the parameter function.

Test it: finish writing the testAddEachArrayElementToScreen() test. If it works,
then "one, two, three" should be added to the document as an html list.
Confirm this visually, did they show up in the left part of the test.html document after
the page loaded?
