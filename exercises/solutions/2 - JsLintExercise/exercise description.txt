basic:

Run jsLint (execute scripts/jsLint.bat). jsLint reports a list of problems with 
the JsLintExercise.js. Fix all the problems. Note: jsLint may report only one problem
at first. There are several others, though.

bonus:

While fixing the problems, discuss them aloud to yourself or a partner. 
Would the code still run with each problem left in? 
If the code runs, how serious is the problem?
