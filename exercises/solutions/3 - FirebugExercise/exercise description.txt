basic:

Start Firefox. Open the Firebug tool. Load the index.html page. 
With Firebug, change the style of the page - without reloading the page or editing the css file.
Do the following changes:

- Change background color of document to blue
- Change text color of document to yellow
- Double the font size

bonus:

Use the Firebug interactive console to add a button with some behavior: When the button is clicked, pop up
a dialog ( alert("Button pressed!"); ). Again, both button and its event handler must be added directly
using Firebug. No editing of the js file allowed, no reload of index.html allowed.
Use either jQuery or just raw DOM scripting.
