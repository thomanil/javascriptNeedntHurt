# 'JavaScript Needn't Hurt!' workshop

Material for a small workshop intended to get attendees started with modern, basic JavaScript development. Includes syntax intro, how to avoid "sharp edges" in the language, basics of DOM scripting, best practices plus super quick intro to jQuery.

The intended audience is software developers with Java or C# backgrounds, possibly with some dynamic language background.

One way to use this workshop:

* Use the lecture notes and slides to hold a long-ish talk
* Then let people loose on the exercises.

NOTE: The project is somewhat large because every exercise/example has a full project setup included locally in their directories, including JSLint jar binaries. I set it up that way to let pupils very easily simply copy, move, reuse the project dirs after the workshop.


# Required tools

Participants should install Firefox, Firebug and make sure they have a Java Runtime Environment installed.
